# rpm2023_text_mining_workshop

This tutorial is a hands-on introduction to the use of natural language processing for textual analysis with the most common Python packages. It will demonstrate steps in the process including pre-processing and preparing text data, foundational algorithms and results visualization. The code examples will be provided with an emphasis on foundational skills to enable independent exploration after the conference.
